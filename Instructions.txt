This Lumberjack game is a clone of the Timber game, which is based on ideas and concepts from LinkedIn's course "C++ Game Programming 1"
and "Beginning C++ Game Programming" both by John Horton.

-You must have installed SFML 2.4.0 32 bit version (SFML-2.4.0-windows-vc14-32)
-The installation package is provided with this project, look for the "SFML-2.4.0-windows-vc14-32-bit.zip" file
-The installation folder must be: "C:\Program Files (x86)\SFML"


Building the game with Visual Studio (2019)
-With the Solution open, right-click on Timber, and then click on Properties
-On Configuration Drowndown menu select 'All configurations'
-Selecting 'C/C++' -> 'General' -> on 'Additional Include Directories' field add the following directory 'C:\Program Files (x86)\SFML\include\'
	*Note: If 'C:\Program Files (x86)\SFML' is not your SFML installation you should adjust it accordingly to your settings.

-Selecting 'Linker' -> 'General' -> on 'Additional Include Directories' field add the following directory 'C:\Program Files (x86)\SFML\lib'
	*Note: If 'C:\Program Files (x86)\SFML' is not your SFML installation you should adjust it accordingly to your settings.

-On Configuration Drowndown menu select 'Debug'
-Then go to 'Linker' -> 'General' -> 'Input' -> on 'Aditional Dependencies' field append the following string 
	'sfml-graphics-d.lib;sfml-window-d.lib;sfml-system-d.lib;sfml-system-d.lib;sfml-network-d.lib;sfml-audio-d.lib;'
	The working copy ideally should look like this:
	'sfml-graphics-d.lib;sfml-window-d.lib;sfml-system-d.lib;sfml-system-d.lib;sfml-network-d.lib;sfml-audio-d.lib;kernel32.lib;user32.lib;gdi32.lib;winspool.lib;comdlg32.lib;advapi32.lib;shell32.lib;ole32.lib;oleaut32.lib;uuid.lib;odbc32.lib;odbccp32.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)'

-On Configuration Drowndown menu select 'Release'
-Then go to 'Linker' -> 'General' -> 'Input' -> on 'Aditional Dependencies' field append the following string 
	'sfml-graphics.lib;sfml-window.lib;sfml-system.lib;sfml-network.lib;sfml-audio.lib;'
	The working copy ideally should look like this:
	'sfml-graphics.lib;sfml-window.lib;sfml-system.lib;sfml-network.lib;sfml-audio.lib;kernel32.lib;user32.lib;gdi32.lib;winspool.lib;comdlg32.lib;advapi32.lib;shell32.lib;ole32.lib;oleaut32.lib;uuid.lib;odbc32.lib;odbccp32.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)'
